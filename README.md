### SFDC AI Hackathon 2025 – Project: Smarter Deputy Report (DR) Processing for OPGO

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Currently, both **Deputies** and **Officers** face significant friction in using the **OPGO system** for annual Deputy Report (DR) submissions and reviews.

- **Deputies** find the portal confusing and time-consuming when entering financial details or uploading supporting documents.  
  This often results in **incomplete, inconsistent, or error-prone submissions**.
- **Officers** must manually verify receipts and bank statements, tally expenses in Excel, and cross-check data outside the system — a **slow, repetitive, and error-prone process**.

This fragmented workflow:
- Reduces operational efficiency ⚙️  
- Increases risk of oversight ⚠️  
- Limits officers’ capacity to focus on higher-risk cases 🔍

## 💡 Proposed Solution

### For Deputies
- 🧾 **AI-powered document processing** using OCR + ML to extract data from uploaded receipts, bank statements, and invoices.  
- 🪄 **Auto-population of form fields** (e.g. date, amount, category) in the OPGO reporting interface.  
- 👁️ **Live data preview** so Deputies can verify extracted data before submission.  
- ⚠️ **Smart validation prompts** to detect mismatched totals, duplicates, or missing fields — improving data quality at the source.

### For Officers
- 📊 **AI-generated**
