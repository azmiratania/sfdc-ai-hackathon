### SFDC AI Hackathon 2025  
**Project:** Smarter Deputy Report (DR) Processing for OPGO
💬 “Empowering Deputies, Supporting Officers — AI for a more humane and efficient OPG process.”

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Currently, both **Deputies** and **Officers** face significant friction when using the **OPGO system** for annual Deputy Report (DR) submissions and reviews.

- **Deputies** find the portal confusing and time-consuming when entering financial details or uploading supporting documents.  
  This often results in **incomplete, inconsistent, or error-prone submissions**.
- **Officers** must manually verify receipts and bank statements, tally expenses in Excel, and cross-check data outside the system — a **slow, repetitive, and error-prone process**.

This fragmented workflow:
- Reduces operational efficiency ⚙️  
- Increases risk of oversight ⚠️  
- Limits officers’ capacity to focus on higher-risk cases 🔍  

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution

### For Deputies
- 🧾 **AI-powered document processing** (OCR + ML) to extract data from uploaded receipts, bank statements, and invoices.  
- 🪄 **Auto-population of form fields** such as date, amount, and category in the OPGO reporting interface.  
- 👁️ **Live data preview** for verification before submission.  
- ⚠️ **Smart validation prompts** to detect mismatched totals, duplicates, or missing entries — improving data quality at the source.

### For Officers
- 📊 **AI-generated summaries** of submitted reports, highlighting key financial figures, discrepancies, and missing data.  
- 🤖 **Cross-validation algorithms** that match extracted data with reported figures to flag inconsistencies automatically.

## 🎯 Impact

By automating and enhancing the end-to-end DR submission and review process, OPG can:

- ✅ Reduce manual verification effort  
- ✅ Improve data accuracy and consistency  
- ✅ Speed up review turnaround time  
- ✅ Allow Officers to focus on **high-risk or complex cases**  
- ✅ Help Deputies complete reports with **confidence and clarity**
